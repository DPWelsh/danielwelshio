#### Friday

Went to Gym,

traded all day and then took chrissy out for a really nice dinner at common grounds new italian restaurants.

#### Saturday

Went to the gym - feeling fit

Went for a surf with rhino and caitlan - pushed her onto a wave and it was sick! Bug was also there and he cooked up a storm of vege goodness.

Went for an arvo surf at boobs. one of the local old fellas swore at me for being in the way - what a douche.

I started being about to do layback turns - pretty stoked.

Chrissy and I went to funky ninja for dinner - had chicken, veges and fried rice with a coke. I told chrissy that I wanted to go to goldy by myself - she was upset but has finally come good now.

# First Blog Post - What I am currently working / spending time on in Feb 2021.

## First Journal Entry

Today is the day that I start writing and keeping track of my life. I will aim to write something everyday.

I will start adding to this list as we go through everything. I may even try to add and track monthly / weekly goals on the below.

Potentially adding in daily summaries of the below items.. It shouldn't be too hard to copy and paste a template each day.

## Motorcycle Course Completion

I have just completed two days of my motorbike course with my instructor Russel. Russel was a strange human-being, however he was entertaining and served his purpose. Highlight of the course was getting my licence and I suppose just experiencing something new. A lowlight was getting 9 questions wrong in the knowledge test and having to come back at 7:00 and re-doing the test for $45. It was also highly embarassing and hurt my ego a fair bit...

Jordan offered to lend me his DRX650, however his rego is out and I am going to have to book in a vic roads appointment and sort that out myself. That, or buy my own bike, which I don't really want to do at this moment.

## 8 Week Challenge - Bodyfit.

Today also marks the first serious day of the 8 week challenge at bodyfit. I'm going to try hard at losing the 5kgs and get as fit as I can for the triathlon in a 4 week.s

## First ever Triathlon - Barwon Heads Triathlon.

I have signed up for my first ever triathlon on the 28th Feb. I probably should have time speed / time goals.

## Eat the rich

Jordan Parker has started an "Eat the Rich" group which will focus on programattic trading. Hopefully this group will flourish into some v nice gainz.

## Codabunga

I have started a little coding website for Gina Welsh and I. We will hopefully use the site to be able to post up little projects as they come along.

## Tom Crowns Crypto

I have joined a monthly patreon where I will be learning about trading cryptos at a more sophisticated level. There will be one-on-one sessions as well as daily live streams. I plan to trade crypto as a semi full-time thing until I make some gainz.

I need to set up a target income / money stream so that I don't lose out in the long-run.

## Clouru Designs

I have started a front-end design company. My first client was Oakleigh Foundation - Supporting Indigenous Australian Education.
I was only able to make the website using Squarespace - I would like to redesign it using Kirby once I have the ability and time to do so.

## Clouru Consulting.

I need to start working on the Clouru Cloud Consulting side of this. I know that this will make me money in the long run as a good source of income - this will provide me with the cashflow that I need.

### Cloud costing App.

- set up domains
- set up front end webpage.
